# Once upon a time:  The white or rather clear Coca-Cola of the 1940's

> When Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower introduced Coke to Zhukov, the Russian liked it. 
> But he also knew how Stalin would react if one of his generals was seen drinking an American imperialist symbol. The folks at Coke were as accommodating as could be. A chemist removed the soda's caramel color, and they put the drink in a clear bottle with a white cap and red star. 
> First shipment of White Coke: 50 cases. 

All in the name of world peace. Clearly that didn't help warming the soviet leadership. Not much good 
can come from diluting or messing up a perfect drink. Is it really Coke without the caramel ?
